# gw-mac

This tool attempts to figure out a "network identifier", in order to be able
to recognize when the program is re-run again in the same network as it has
run in before.

## Network identifier

The identifer is generated depending on IPv4/IPv6 availability.

## IPv4 netid

The MAC address of the machine working as default gateway.

## IPv6 netid

The prefixes of the global scope addresses.
